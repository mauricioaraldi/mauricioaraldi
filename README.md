### Hello!

"Lover of Open-Web, music, games, poetry and everything more."

That's really me =)

I love to play around with new concepts, try different ideas and create projects to learn.

My main role is JavaScript developer. I'm currently working on improving my skills as well as to learn a little bit about more complex canvas and maybe some AI.

Here are some of my on-progress projects that you can find online:
* [ParkIt](https://mauricioaraldi.github.io/parkit/)
* [Moba Drafter](https://mauricioaraldi.github.io/moba-drafter/)
* [COVID Ghost Town](https://covid-ghost-town.vercel.app/en-US/brazil)
* [Diablo 2 Item cropper](https://mauricioaraldi.github.io/d2-item-cropper/)
