### Hello!

"Lover of Open-Web, music, games, poetry and everything more."

That's really me =)

I love to play around with new concepts, try different ideas and create projects to learn.

My main role is JavaScript developer, as you can clearly see by looking around. I'm currently working on improving those skills as well as to learn a little bit about more complex canvas and maybe some AI.

Here are some of my on-progress projects that you can find online:
* [ParkIt](https://mauricioaraldi.github.io/parkit/)
* [Moba Drafter](https://mauricioaraldi.github.io/moba-drafter/)

You can also find me in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauricio-luis-comin-araldi-a1279a17a/)
